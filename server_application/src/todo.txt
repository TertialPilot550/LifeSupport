so there is basically one endpoint and one set of functionalities.

What do I actually want this to be?
Is it just a database tool with security and then I build the smaller application around it?
or should there be other features, maybe like adding objects to the program and recompiling?


Could define types in a text file type thing maybe? 

    Create one master repository of objects that have a string called a type 

        class LooselyTypedData {
            int id;
            String name;
            String type;
            String data;
        }

    Then, when determining how to deal with the objects, and any information about what the objects hold or whatever they can just refer to the type files. Could have a rest controller related to types
